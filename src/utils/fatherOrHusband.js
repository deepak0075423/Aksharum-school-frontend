 * A teacher's "father's / husband's name" is one field, asked for by gender
 * (Oct 2026): a man gives his father's name, a woman her father's or her
 * husband's. Other, or no gender chosen yet, keeps the combined label.
 *
 * Same wording on the server (school-backend/utils/fatherOrHusband.js) and in
 * the app (Nexora-Hives/utils/fatherOrHusband.ts).
 *
 *   fatherOrHusbandLabel('Male')                 → "Father's Name"
 *   fatherOrHusbandLabel('Female', 'sentence')   → "Father's / husband's name"
